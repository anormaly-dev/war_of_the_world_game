# War Of The World Game

This project serves as a demonstration of how to use [Phaser.js](https://phaser.io/) to create a simple yet engaging adventure game.

## How to play

To run the project just open the root directory and run on your browser the html file.
Have fun and I hope someone will reach level two.


## Talking voice in background

If you are hearing a voice in background it's a javascript library which tells essentially the story of the game and whats is going on.
If you notice a strange accent it may be because your browser it's in a different language rather than english.
The technology used to make a voice read your text it's [Speechsyntesis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis).
